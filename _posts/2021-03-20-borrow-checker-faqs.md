excerpt: tips and tricks for dealing with the borrow-checker
---

I got lots of positive feedback about [the FAQ
section](https://jyn514.github.io/2020/09/05/Rust-in-2021.html#faq) in my Rust 2020 blog post, so
I'm trying that format again for another topic that's been requested a lot: How to fix common
borrow-checker issues. This isn't meant to explain how or why the borrow checker works the way it
does (see [The Nomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html) or [Two Beautiful Rust
Programs](https://matklad.github.io/2020/07/15/two-beautiful-programs.html) for that), just how
to work around some of its current limitations.

In a small break from the format, the 'questions' will instead be Rust code and the accompanying
compiler error. I make no pretense that the code is doing useful work, it's just meant to give
examples of errors.

> How do I modify elements in a collection while also modifying the collection?

[Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=90cf38acb25060d159d46933ba3a0608)

```rust
let mut queue = vec![1, 2, 3];
for elem in queue.iter_mut() {
    *elem += 2;
    queue.push(*elem + 1);
}
```
```
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `queue` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:5:9
  |
3 |     for elem in queue.iter_mut() {
  |                 ----------------
  |                 |
  |                 first mutable borrow occurs here
  |                 first borrow later used here
4 |         *elem += 2;
5 |         queue.push(*elem + 1);
  |         ^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
```

This happens because for-loops borrow the iterator for the *whole* loop, not just for a single
iteration. You can work around it by using `while let` instead:

```rust
let mut queue = vec![1, 2, 3];
while let Some(mut elem) = queue.pop() {
    elem += 2;
    queue.push(elem + 1);
}
```

Note that this has a behavior change: unlike the previous loop, this removes the element from the
queue before modifying it. You can get the behavior from before back by adding `queue.insert(0,
elem)` (although at that point you may want to use a
[`VecDeque`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html)).

> I have disjoint fields in a struct, but because I use one in a closure, I can't use the other.

```rust
struct S {
    elems: Vec<i32>,
    metadata: i32,
}

let mut s = S {
    elems: vec![1, 2, 3],
    metadata: 0,
};
std::thread::spawn(|| {
    for x in s.elems {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
});

println!("{}", s.metadata);
```
```
error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s`
  --> src/main.rs:18:16
   |
8  | let s = S {
   |     - move occurs because `s` has type `S`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
12 | std::thread::spawn(|| {
   |                    -- value moved into closure here
13 |     for x in s.elems {
   |              ------- variable moved due to use in closure
...
18 | println!("{}", s.metadata);
   |                ^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
```

This happens because the closure captures the whole `s` struct, not just the fields it needs.
You can explicitly say which fields to capture by adding a `let` statement:

```rust
let elems = s.elems;
std::thread::spawn(|| {
    for x in elems {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
});
```

This is done automatically for you with `#![feature(capture_disjoint_fields)]`, which will
hopefully be [enabled by default](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-rfc-2229/milestones) in the 2021 edition.

Similar issues happen for structs that aren't `Send` or `Sync`:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
struct S {
    elems: Vec<i32>,
    metadata: RefCell<i32>,
}

let s = S {
    elems: vec![1, 2, 3],
    metadata: RefCell::new(0),
};
std::thread::spawn(|| {
    for x in &s.elems {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
});

println!("{}", s.metadata.borrow());
```
```
error[E0277]: `RefCell<i32>` cannot be shared between threads safely
   --> src/main.rs:16:1
    |
16  | std::thread::spawn(|| {
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `RefCell<i32>` cannot be shared between threads safely
    |

error: aborting due to previous error
```

If you only need a few of the fields, you can add explicit `let` statements in the same way.

```rust
let elems = s.elems;
std::thread::spawn(|| {
    for x in elems {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
});
println!("{}", s.metadata.borrow());
```

> Moving a line of code into a separate function makes it fail to compile.

There are actually quite a few things that will cause this. The most common are:

1. The compiler can no longer tell you're using disjoint fields.
2. You wrote the wrong lifetimes (or the elided lifetimes are wrong).

An example of 1 ([Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=2f84148a276b0c8595a8023363f2f6a7)):

```rust
struct S {
    elems: Vec<i32>,
    metadata: i32,
}

impl S {
    fn set_metadata(&mut self, val: i32) {
        self.metadata = val;
    }
}

let mut s = S {
    elems: vec![1, 2, 3],
    metadata: 0,
};
let _elems = s.elems; // moves out of `elems`
s.metadata = 1; // works fine
s.set_metadata(1); // breaks because `elems` is moved
```
```
error[E0382]: borrow of partially moved value: `s`
  --> src/main.rs:22:1
   |
20 | let elems = s.elems; // moves out of `elems`
   |             ------- value partially moved here
21 | s.metadata = 1; // works fine
22 | s.set_metadata(1); // breaks because `elems` is moved
   | ^ value borrowed here after partial move
   |
   = note: partial move occurs because `s.elems` has type `Vec<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```

There is no simple fix for this; this is the main reason getters and setters are discouraged in
Rust. You can either manually inline the code, or change your struct so that the relevant parts
use composition instead of all being in the same struct:

```rust
struct S {
    elems: Vec<i32>,
    metadata: Inner,
}
struct Inner(i32);

impl Inner {
    fn set_metadata(&mut self, val: i32) {
        *self = Inner(val);
    }
}

let mut s = S {
    elems: vec![1, 2, 3],
    metadata: Inner(0),
};
let _elems = s.elems; // moves out of `elems`
s.metadata = Inner(1); // works fine
s.metadata.set_metadata(1); // works fine
```

An example of 2 ([Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=99a4597a50b4c7915325ef1caa287040)):

```rust
struct S<'a>(&'a i32);

impl S<'_> {
    fn inner(&self) -> &i32 {
        self.0
    }
}

let x = 0;
let _p = {
    let s = S(&x);
    s.0
};

let _q = {
    let s = S(&x);
    s.inner() // error: does not live long enough
};
```

This one is tricky to spot: the issue isn't the code you wrote, but rather the code you *didn't* write.
If you desugar `inner()`, it would be something like

```rust
fn inner<'s>(&'s self) -> &'s i32 {
    self.0
}
```

But this is unnecessarily restrictive - `self.0` lives longer than `self`. The fix is to write the lifetime yourself:

```rust
impl<'a> S<'a> {
    fn inner(&self) -> &'a i32 {
        self.0
    }
}
```

There are a lot more variants of this. I might publish a follow-up post with more.

> How can I use an iterator from a struct when I also need mutable access? I know that my changes won't affect the iterator.

[Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=d5324bfe8d3429c6f40fe09bd52c7d04)

```rust
// same `s` from earlier example
struct S {
    elems: Vec<i32>,
    metadata: i32,
}

let mut s = S {
    elems: vec![1, 2, 3],
    metadata: 0,
};

for x in s.elems.iter() {
    takes_s(*x, &mut s);
}

fn takes_s(x: i32, s: &mut S) {
    s.metadata = x;
}
```
```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/main.rs:13:17
   |
12 | for x in s.elems.iter() {
   |          --------------
   |          |
   |          immutable borrow occurs here
   |          immutable borrow later used here
13 |     takes_s(*x, &mut s);
   |                 ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
```

You can `.collect` the iterator before using it:

```rust
let iter: Vec<_> = s.elems.iter().copied().collect();
for x in iter {
    takes_s(x, &mut s);
}
```

Note that this isn't ideal in several ways:
- If you're wrong that `takes_s` doesn't affect the iterator, it changes the behavior.
- It makes the iterator eager instead of lazy, which means you have to allocate a new collection
    (you don't strictly have to use `Vec`, but there's no reason to use anything else).
- It requires either copying or cloning the elements.

However, in some cases, there's no alternative. See [this Rustdoc
PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82020#discussion_r575905338) for a real-world example.
