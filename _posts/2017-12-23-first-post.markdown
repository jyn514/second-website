**Hello, World!**

This is my first post on the new and improved site using [jekyll][jekyll-gh].
It will (hopefully) be the first of many. Feel free to explore the source code [here][website-gh].

I started this site from an offhand comment by my good friend [Charles Daniels][cd-gh].
We were working on a [side project][bitshuffle] together when I suggested
signing release commits with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/).
He was surprised I had experience with PGP keys, and his first question was "Do you have a blog?"

From that simple question sprung this site. I hope you enjoy!
