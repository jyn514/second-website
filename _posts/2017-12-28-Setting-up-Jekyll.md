Jekyll is a wonderful program. The more I use it, the more I like it.
It's customizable, automatically parses markdown, and uses a template system
that makes it very easy to create a consistent style. Its only flaw is that
it depends on [rubygems]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-12-28-Setting-up-Jekyll.md %}#appendix).

Jekyll does get a little getting used to, however.
In this article, I'll go over the basics:
1. Installing
2. Creating a site
3. Customizing a site
4. Creating content

Note that I assume some basic familiarity with [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
and the commandline, which will be covered in another post.

## Installing
If you don't have [rubygems](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
installed, you'll need it. See also 
[footnote 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-12-28-Setting-up-Jekyll.md %}#appendix).

{% highlight sh %}
gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

## Creating a site
{% highlight sh %}
jekyll new <directory>
cd $_
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

Congratulations! Your site is now live
(at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) by default).

## Customizing your site
"Your awesome title" is a pretty terribly name for a site.
Go ahead and edit it in `_config.yml`.
There's lots of other juicy config to change in there,
quick rundown [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).

### Other things to edit
Jekyll uses [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/)
by default; find where it is with `bundle show minima`.
{% highlight sh %}
cp -r $(bundle show minima)/* <directory>
{% endhighlight %}

- CSS: `_sass/minima/`
- Page layouts: `_layouts/`
- Headers and footers: `_includes/`
- 404 page: `404.html`

## Creating content
Jekyll expects a certain format from its templates. I've made an
[script](https://github.com/jyn514/jyn514.github.io/blob/master/scripts/new_post)
that will handle the metadata automatically.

The content itself can be in one of three formats:
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- HTML
- Plain text

The [source](https://github.com/jyn514/jyn514.github.io/)
of my site is also available as an example.

## Appendix
- If, like me, you got a permissions error -
{% highlight sh %}
joshua@debian-thinkpad:/usr/local/src/second-website$ gem install jekyll
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Errno::EACCES)
    Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /var/lib/ruby/2.3.0/gem/specs
{% endhighlight %}
then you probably installed with a package manager. Unfortunately,
you'll have to reinstall gem; I'm not aware of any way around this.
Since installing on a system-wide basis requires root permissions,
/var/lib/ruby is only read/writable for root.

- If you want to edit where gems are stored, you'll have to edit
the rubygem script itself. Find the ruby library (in my case,
`/usr/lib/ruby`) and {% highlight sh %}
cd 2.3.0/rubygems
sed -i "s/File.join Gem.user_home, '.gem'/File.join Gem.user_home, '.local', 'lib', 'gem'/" **
{% endhighlight %}
