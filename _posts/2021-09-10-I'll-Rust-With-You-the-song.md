# I'll Rust With You: the song

Niko Matsakis, co-lead for the Rust language team, recently published a song titled ["Edition: the
song"][edition-song]. I decided I was not to be outdone and sang a cover of "I'll Rust With You", by
[Steam Powered Giraffe][spg]. The song has absolutely no relation to the Rust language other than
the title, I just think it's fun.
