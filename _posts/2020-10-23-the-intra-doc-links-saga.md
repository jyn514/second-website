excerpt: How I helped stabilize intra-doc links
---

One of my projects for the last 4 months or so has been working on
['intra-doc links'](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43466), a feature of `rustdoc`
that lets you link to items by name. That feature will be stable in 4 weeks in
Rust 1.48.0!

**@Manishearth** and I wrote a longer blog post about intra-doc links which you
can read on [the official Rust blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/09/17/stabilizing-intra-doc-links.html).
