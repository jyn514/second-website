excerpt: Why HRTB are my least-favorite part of Rust
---

This is a story about type signatures, Higher Ranked Trait Bounds ([HRTB]), and the most
confusing diagnostics bug I've seen in the Rust compiler. Along the way we'll learn how
[`pulldown-cmark`] has been trying to fix the same API for 3 different releases, and discover
that some bugs only appear at the compile time of downstream crates.

If you don't know what some of the words mean, there is [an appendix](#appendix). Unfortunately,
this article needs too much background knowledge to fit all of it in a blog post.

## Background

Our story starts with a simple change to rustdoc: It wants to [hide the `[]`][#79781] around [intra-doc links] in search results.
(For context, search results have links stripped since otherwise the relative links would be broken, which means rustdoc needs to do some preprocessing of the markdown.)
That would turn screenshots like this:

into this:

![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37223377/101309591-a0dea280-3801-11eb-85e1-620549f64bf6.png)

Rustdoc does this in several [different][markdown_summary] [places][plain_text_summary], so
naturally this should be pulled out into a single function that can be reused. This is a callback
to pulldown's markdown [`Parser`](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/0.8.0/pulldown_cmark/struct.Parser.html).

```rust
// Omitted: in real life, this would only mark intra-doc links as valid, not all broken links.
fn summary_broken_link_callback<'a>(link: BrokenLink<'a>) -> Option<(CowStr<'a>, CowStr<'a>)> {
    Some(("#".into(), link.reference.to_owned().into()))
}
```

Except that doesn't work:

```

```

## Lifetime annotations: action at a distance

What on earth is going on here? We have a simple function that takes a link and returns it, right?
What does that have to do with "higher-ranked subtypes" and `'static`? To find out, we have to look
at the definition of [`new_with_broken_link_callback()`][new_with].

```rust
pub fn new_with_broken_link_callback(
    text: &'a str,
    options: Options,
    broken_link_callback: Option<&'a mut dyn FnMut(BrokenLink<'_>) -> Option<(CowStr<'a>, CowStr<'a>)>>
) -> Parser<'a> { /* ... */ }
```

Wow! There's a lot going on here, especially in `broken_link_callback`. Let's take that type apart a little:

- `Option` means the callback is optional; if you pass in `None` it will just do nothing.
- `&'a mut` is a mutable reference.
- `FnMut(BrokenLink<'_>) -> Option<(CowStr<'a>, CowStr<'a>)>` is a trait for 'functions taking `BrokenLink` and returning a tuple of `CowStr`'.
- Because `FnMut` is a *trait* and not a type, `dyn` turns it into a type (i.e. this is [runtime polymorphism]).

But there's something funny here - the *same* lifetime `'a` is used for both the reference to the
function, and the types it outputs. That's what made our function break: since
`summary_broken_link_callback` is a function, any reference to it has a `'static` lifetime.
Fortunately, Rust will implicitly [reborrow] the reference if it lives too long. Unfortunately,
we don't know how long it *should* live. That's why the error is mentioning `'static`; since it can't figure out the right lifetime, it falls back to the longest possible.
By looking at the definition of [`Parser`], we can see why that gives an error about `md`:

```rust
pub struct Parser<'a> {
    md: &'a str,
    broken_link_callback: BrokenLinkCallback<'a>,
    // ... some fields omitted
}

pub type BrokenLinkCallback<'a> =
    Option<&'a mut dyn FnMut(BrokenLink) -> Option<(CowStr<'a>, CowStr<'a>)>>;
```

So there's *many* lifetimes that have been tied together here:

1. The lifetime of the input, `md`
2. The lifetime of the borrow, `&mut broken_link_callback`
3. The lifetime of the function *outputs*, which are unnamed here (pulldown [calls them][src] `url` and `title`).

And that explains all the errors:

1. `md` is a temporary, but `&mut broken_link_callback` is `'static`
2. `&mut broken_link_callback` can't find an appropriate lifetime for the borrow, so it gives up altogether with "higher-ranked subtype error"
3. The arguments are temporaries, so the outputs are temporaries too (because we declared `broken_link_callback` as `fn summary_broken_link_callback<'a>(link: BrokenLink<'a>) -> Option<(CowStr<'a>, CowStr<'a>)>`), but `&mut broken_link_callback` is `'static`

## [How do you solve a problem like a lifetime?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VRyQprlu8)

Notice that the bug here is *not* in `broken_link_callback` - it's in the API itself, which is
tying the lifetimes together unnecessarily. If you write `broken_link_callback` on its own, it
will compile and run just fine, it's only the way that it interacts with `Parser` that breaks
things. The fix is not to tie the lifetimes together:

```rust
pub struct Parser<'input, 'callback> {
    text: &'input str,
    broken_link_callback: BrokenLinkCallback<'input, 'callback>,
}

pub type BrokenLinkCallback<'input, 'borrow> =
    Option<&'borrow mut dyn FnMut(BrokenLink<'input>) -> Option<(CowStr<'input>, CowStr<'input>)>>;
```

Notice that 1. and 3. are still tied together; this is because pulldown has an API that yields
[events with the lifetime of the input][Item]. To use the output of the callback in the
`Iterator` implementation, the outputs have to live as long as the full markdown input, not just
the current link.

An interesting note is that `broken_link_callback` had a similar issue over overspecifying lifetimes:
if you change the type signature to

```rust
fn summary_broken_link_callback<'a>(
	link: BrokenLink<'_>
) -> Option<(CowStr<'a>, CowStr<'a>)> {
  Some(("#".into(), link.reference.to_owned().into()))
}
```

it will suddenly compile. In particular, the lifetime of the input is no longer tied to the lifetime of the output,
which works because `link.reference` is copied, not borrowed.

For more information about this problem, including strange and disconcerting errors that show up
if you give lifetimes the wrong annotations, see [the issue] against pulldown, as well as [the
PR] I made fixing it.

## Bonus: Wait, where's my diagnostics bug? I was promised a diagnostics bug!

For some reason, the error in a stand-alone program is different from the one when you compile `broken_link_callback` as part of rustdoc:

```

    = note: `for<'a> fn(pulldown_cmark::BrokenLink<'a>) -> Option<(pulldown_cmark::CowStr<'a>, pulldown_cmark::CowStr<'a>)> {callback}` must implement `FnOnce<(pulldown_cmark::BrokenLink<'_>,)>`
    = note: ...but `FnOnce<(pulldown_cmark::BrokenLink<'_>,)>` is actually implemented for the type `for<'a> fn(pulldown_cmark::BrokenLink<'a>) -> Option<(pulldown_cmark::CowStr<'a>, pulldown_cmark::CowStr<'a>)> {callback}`
```

In particular, the `note:` makes no sense: it shows the same types above and below!
This is a long-lived [diagnostics issue] with the compiler itself, going back [at least until 2017][closure-hrtb].
